This app is written with the following technologies:

- HTML

- JavaScript

- JQuery

- an API call to the hiking project

- Google Maps technology

This app is something we created to help people get info on trails in the Seattle area.
It will provide a quick list of things you might want to know about a hike.
People are able to comment about any hike on the map.
All you have to do to learn about a hike is click on a marker.
You can tell how difficult a hike is by the icon it has on the map.
