# Take a hike

## A Website to help users find local hikes

The app is written with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
This app is something we created to get info on trails in the seattle area.
it will provide a quick list of things you might want to know about a hike
people are able to comment about any hike on the map
all you have to do to learn about a hike is click on a marker
You can tell how difficult a hike is by the icon it has on the map
